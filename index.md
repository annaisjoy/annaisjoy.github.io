### 🍱 Beyond the Code

When I'm not in the terminal, I'm likely exploring the intersection of food and design:
* 🍵 **Matcha Enthusiast**: On a perpetual quest for the perfect ceremonial-grade whisk.
* 📸 **Photography & Travel**: Capturing the vibe of new cities through my lens.
* 🏂 **Snowboarding**: Chasing fresh powder in the Rockies every winter.
* 🧸 **Pop Mart Collector**: My desk is a rotating gallery of my latest blind box finds!

> **Fun Fact:** I'm a **small food influencer**! I love sharing culinary discoveries and documenting the best eats with my community.
